## Introduction
locale-to-number.js is a library that aids developers to convert string representations of numbers, in a certain locale, to decimal literal numbers. The exact opposite operation is available either by the [Intl.NumberFormat()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat) constructor or the [Number.toLocaleString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toLocaleString) function. However, converting them back to decimal is not trivial. That's where locale-to-number.js comes into play.
